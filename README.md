2021 ASU Barrett Honors College Cohort on modeling misinformation
The primary task was to produce tools for understanding misinformation rather than create classifiers for truth and falsehood, real and fake. 
Students worked on these projects and met weekly during the Fall 2021 Semester:
Will Hymer
Colin Finnegan
Jonathan Zhao
Ninad Kulkarni
Jack Myers
Along with collaboration with Crystal Nguyen, a student researcher with the Unit for Data Science.
